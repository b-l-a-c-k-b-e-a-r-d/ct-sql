`lecsv` uses CT log files generated by ct-sync to produce CSV files of the
domains the Let's Encrypt has issued certificates for.

The CSV records are currently the domain, the certificate's serial number as
hex, the certificate's notBefore as a Unix timestamp in seconds, and the Unix
timestamp in seconds of when the certificate was added to the CT log.

See the `sync_and_csv.sh` for an example of how to use ct-sync and lecsv to
generate CSV files that include only LE certificates from the previous ct-sync.
